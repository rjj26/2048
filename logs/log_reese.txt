----  -------  ----  --------------
12/9 6:00pm    4:00   created my own implementation of 2048 to easily input various policies and record data
12/10 9:00pm   3:00  worked on baseline implementations of human interaction agent, random agent, greedy agent 
12/11 11:00am  4:00  implemented baseline MCTS agents using my MCTS from hw4. Made greedy MCTS agent that finds avg max score of tree branch
12/13 6:00pm   3:00  played around with various hueristic strategies, tried MCTS that is greedy in terms of maximizing number of moves given tree branch
                     turns out max moves did a lot better then Vinh and I would have presumed
12/14 1:00pm   1:00  edited well known C++ expectimax implementaton to record training data "supervised_learning.txt" to attempt to classify state, action pairs
12/14 1:00pm   2:00  attempted way too many variations of the CNN to try and get the NN to learn from the training data, generally unsuccesful due to overfitting,
                     computational limits, lack of knowledge with neural nets etc. Chose one model to go with even though it wasnt ideal

DISCUSSION
Had a lot of fun doing this project, and generally speaking this class was very interesting. Thanks so much for an awesome semester!
