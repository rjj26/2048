12/10 7:00pm   1:00  helped Reese implement the framework for our project: implementing basic baseline players 
                     (random and greedy), make classes for the MCTS agents, and testing script to evalutate agents
                     with various statistics
12/11 7:00pm   4:00  worked on MCTS implementation (standard and heuristics); researched what heuristics are good
                     for 2048 (read literature, git repos, etc.) and decided on 4-5; wrote optimizer script (located in 
                      `other_files` folder) and ran thousands of iterations to try to find optimal weights for the heuristics 
                     (ran in background, but elapsed time for fine-tuning was over a couple of days); 
                     standard implemntation inspired from PSET 4, heuristics implementation was
                     inspired by Reese's version 0 that used max moves instead of score (his file located in `other_files` folder)
12/13 11:00am  2:00  time spent on laptop to check heuristics optimization from script; checked every few hours of the days
12/15 6:00pm   4:30  finished fine-tuning heuristics; wrote a more robust test script; started working on a CNN Regression model
                     that would predict a score based on a board state (obtain training data, trainined model, implement as agent); 
                     idea was to mimic the heuristics code but make it faster with the model; 
                     by training on expert data the model in theory should be able to evalute the value of a board (accounting
                     for both immediate reward (score) and future value (positioning)); model doesn't work that well so decided to not submit
                     as part of project; however, used Reese's model and implemented that into an MCTS agent
12/16 1:00pm   2:30  put description and information in test script; made READme for more robust description of the project, organized file 
                     file structure; wrote a greedy agent that also used heuristics

DISCUSSION
A lot of time was used for fine-tuning weights and training models (not included in the time log) that may not be 
reflected in our code or log files. The implementations of the agents were relatively straightforward, but trying 
to find the best parameters took a lot of trial and error.
